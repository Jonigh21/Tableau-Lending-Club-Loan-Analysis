Tool: Tableau
Completed by: Jonigh McGee


This project uses Lending Club loan data to explore borrower financial patterns and debt risk levels through calculated fields and insightful visualizations. The dashboard answers key business questions, such as:

- What’s the distribution of total annual income across borrowers?

- How does debt-to-income (DTI) vary across loan applicants?

- What percentage of total payments has been received by borrowers with Medium or High DTI levels?

- Which loan purpose categories show lower payment-to-loan performance?

Calculated Fields Used:
- Total Annual Income = Annual Income + Annual Income Joint

- DTI = (Total Debt / Total Annual Income) × 100

- DTI Level = Categorical DTI rating: Low, Medium, or High

- Total Payments to Loans = (Sum of Paid Total / Sum of Loan Amount)

- Payments to Loans Category = Classified as either <15% or 15% or Greater
